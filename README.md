# Coinbase Project - Crypro Data ETL Pipeline

## Overview
This project is a lightweight ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to fetch granular historical market data ("Ground Truth") for cryptocurrency pairs (BTC-USD, ETH-USD). It connects to the Coinbase Pro Public API, retrieves OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data, and persists it into a local SQLite database for downstream analysis.

## Project Structure
* `pipeline.py`: The core ETL script that extracts raw candle data, handles API rate limits/pagination, and loads data into SQLite.
* `pipeline_visualization.py`: Queries the local database, aggregates metrics by hour, and generates dual-axis charts.
* `crypto_data.db`: The local SQLite database generated by the pipeline.
* `data_quality_analysis.md`: Detailed findings regarding volume discrepancies and anomalies (Answer to Part 2 of Project).

## Key Features
* **Pagination Logic:** Implements an algorithm to bypass the Coinbase API's 300-candle limit by chunking time windows dynamically based on granularity.
* **Rate Limiting:** Includes built-in delays to respect API throughput limits and prevent 429 errors.
* **Idempotency:** Uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` logic and composite primary keys to ensure the pipeline can be re-run without creating duplicate records.
* **Data Standardization:** Converts raw Unix timestamps into human-readable ISO 8601 format (UTC) during the transformation layer.

## Technical Details
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Source:** Coinbase Pro Public API (`/products/{id}/candles`)
* **Storage:** SQLite (`crypto_data.db`)
* **Libraries:** `requests`, `sqlite3`

## How to Run
